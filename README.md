Emotion Detection Using Physiological Signals


This project aims to create a mockup model for detecting the emotional state of a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using physiological signals such as heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and EEG band powers (alpha, beta, theta).
The process involves three main steps:
1. Simulating physiological data for different emotional states.
2. Building a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier).
3. Predicting emotional states based on input features.

1. Simulating Data
We simulate physiological data for three emotional states: Calm, Happy, and Anxious. Each state is associated with distinct patterns of heart rate, HRV, and EEG band powers.
